# ResqGuessr
Local Knowledge Training Tool for Rescue Workers, inspired by GeoGuessr

This tool is designed to help rescue workers, such as ambulance drivers, improve their knowledge of streets and important points of interest (POIs) in their area. Users are given the name of a POI, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or fire stations, or a street name, and must select the correct location on the map. This helps responders navigate more efficiently to critical destinations, making it ideal for training and improving response times.
